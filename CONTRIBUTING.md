## 🏛️ Constitutional Law

All web development is governed by **[`LAW.md`](LAW.md)** and **[`ECOSYSTEM.md`](ECOSYSTEM.md)**.
- **Law W1 (Universal Provider Isolation)**: Storage uses `storage_key`. No raw vendor SDKs in UI components.
- **Law U14 (Zero Loose Code)**: Strict, deterministic TypeScript interfaces for all props and API responses.
- **Law U15 (Human-Readable Code)**: No alien syntax, dense nested ternaries, or unreadable regex hacks.
